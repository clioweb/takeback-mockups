1. Background/History of Project
    * Rolling Stone article
    * Hannah Graham's disappearance
    * Institutional cycles of forgetting, 4 year turn over of students
      can support the claims that people did not know

2. Literature Review
    * Rich Prospect Browsing
    * Feminist Interface Design
    * Respectful telling of stories

3. Examples of how we are using RPB and FID
    * Constraints: Cannot use tools like Omeka straight out of the box
    * Constraints: Mapping and exhibits...deep tension between
      respectfully telling the story of sexual violence and creating
      exhibits of 'benumbing spectacle/naarcissistic identification' (Jenny's work here, Saidiya Hartman)
    * LoC work that Ivy has been doing
    * Highly experimental and iterative, may change
